## Initial Entry

### Current Project State

Existing backend is a Chatbot CRM with Telegram/Meta webhooks, AI agents, inbox, contacts, human takeover, order/complaint legacy flows, and MongoDB runtime.

### New Target

Telegram-first marketplace MVP:

```txt
Product catalog
→ cart
→ checkout
→ payment sandbox
→ payment webhook
→ paid order notification
```

### Current Priority

Start with stabilization:

- Secure orders.
- Secure complaints.
- Protect diagnostic routes.
- Preserve Telegram webhook behavior.
- Add idempotency and service boundaries before payment.
